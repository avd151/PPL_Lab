1. Compile a C program with gcc with various options like -S, --save-temps.

2. Use objdump to read the object file of a C program and demonstrate how a stack frame is built and destroyed.

3. Use gdb to read assembly code for C program to find factorial of a number with recursion and demonstrate how parameters are passed using pass by value.

4. Explain how pass by reference works, using assembly code generated using g++ -S on a C++ program.

5. Write a program to develop a software to introduce animals to kids. Implement classes for animals like Dog, Cat, Elephant, Fish etc. With constructor destructor interfaces and variables with public or private access specifies.

6. Write a program to implement various types of geometrical shapes like circle, triangle, square, polygon, and octagon. Circle, triangle, square, polygon, octagon are child classes of base class shape; Square is a polygon, octagon is a polygon.

7. Write a program to demonstrate event and event handlers using Object Oriented Programming.

8. Write a program to raise an exception and handle it.

9. Write a function in LISP to find nth element from a list of m elements.

10. Implement a decision support system for course tracking at a institute using PROLOG. A course is floated by a teacher from a particular department. Various students will enroll a course. Single student can enroll for multiple courses (maximum five per course) provided the student clears the prerequisite courses. A teacher can teach at the most two courses in a semester.
