        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
Answer - Basic blocks 2,  3 and 5 correspond to the  while-loop.
         While loop executes till condition is true and then stops when it is false, 
         whereas if else is conditional statement having jumps.
         Difference is -It can jump to  a block that has been previously executed 
         
        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?
Answer-  For-loop  is  nothing  but  a  while-loop  with  the  initializer
            separated out  into an  initial basic  block, the  body of  the loop
            subsequently, the  increment part at the  end of the loop  body, and
            the conditional jump back to the start of the loop

        int main()
        {
    	    int sum = 0;
    	    int i, j;
    
    	    while(sum < 100) {
    		    sum = sum * 2;
    	    }
    
    	    for(i=0; i<25; i++) {
    		    for(j=0; j<50; j++) {
    			    sum = sum + i*j;
    		    }
    	    }
        }
