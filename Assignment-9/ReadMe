PROBLEM STATEMENT

Implement a decision support system for course tracking at a institute using PROLOG. A course is floated by a teacher from a particular department. Various students will enroll a course. Single student can enroll for multiple courses (maximum five per course) provided the student clears the prerequisite courses. A teacher can teach at the most two courses in a semester.
